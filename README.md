# Fault-Slip-in-Hydraulic-Stimulation-of-Geothermal-Reservoirs
Run scripts for the paper Fault Slip in Hydraulic Stimulation of Geothermal Reservoirs: Governing Mechanisms And Process-Structure Interaction by Inga Berre, Eirik Keilegavlen and Ivar Stefansson (all University of Bergen, Norway).

The simulations were performed using version 1.2.0 of PorePy corresponding to commit fa81d41b5ad46e5acd337b74105c61c4d3e9633f, see https://github.com/pmgbergen/porepy/.
